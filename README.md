===================================================
The activity (y_...) and subject (subject_...) coding were added to the training (X_train.txt) and the test (X_test.txt) sets and the training set to the test set to create one data set.

Looking at names of variables (features.txt) the columns were selected which had  "mean" or "std" in their colnames. 

The activity lables were added from activity_labels.txt.

The column names were added from features.txt.

A tidy data set was formed by taking the mean of the dataset by activity and subject.
